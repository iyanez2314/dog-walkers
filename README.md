# Paw Walkers

With collaboration with a few of my classmates, we created a dog walking dashboard.
This website will keep track of all dogs associated with owners all the owners associated with the dogs and all the dogs associated with the Dog Walkers.
Some of the technologies we used were Bulma CSS for the front end, we used MySQL for the database, and sequelize ORM to speak to the database using javascript.
Some features we would like to add is a owner dashboard so that the owner could either cancel their membership with the dog walkers, add another pet under them, and also book appointments with the dog walkers.
